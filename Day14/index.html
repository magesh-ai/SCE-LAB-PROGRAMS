        What is a promise?
                A promise in js is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
                It has 3 possible states:
                    Pending->Initial state,operation not complete yet.
                    Fulfillef(Resolved)->Operation completed successfully.
                    Rejected->Operation Failed.
                    .then()
        */
